IBM — the leader in enterprise cloud — and Mendix — the leader in low code development — have partnered to help enterprises shorten time-to-value when building applications. IBM Cloud is built for the enterprise, and it is the only cloud that integrates public, private, multi-cloud, and an on-premises data center through a single architecture. Furthermore, it is designed for cognitive workloads. IBM has selected Mendix as the preferred low-code development platform for use on top of IBM Cloud.
