## 1 What Is in This Accessibility Report?

Mendix is an application development platform. This report covers accessibility conformance for web applications created using Mendix Studio Pro or Mendix Studio.

## 2 Who Is Responsible For Accessibility?

Specific accessibility issues reported to Mendix will be treated as bugs. Since not all success criteria can be used with all types of content and Mendix is an application development platform that supports user interface development, several guidelines require certain implementation and content from developers to achieve success. Compliance to accessibility standards is the responsibility of the application developers using the platform.

| Example  | Mendix Platform  | Developer   |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| Header usage        | Provides the options to specify headings (for example `H1`-`H6`). | Responsible for applying correctly, for example by only using an `H1`, logical ordering, or header once. |
| `alt` tags for images | Provides option to a set multi-lingual `alt` text for images.   | Must provide logical `alt` text.   |
| Contrast   | Provides a default theme with enough contrast and option to configure the colors. | Must keep enough contrast when changing the colors.  |
| Visual widgets | Provides visual widgets which are not accessible by definition, for example Charts or Maps. | Developers should take into account the limitation of visual widgets with respect to accessibility and provide a valid alternative like a textual representation. |
| Keyboard tab order  | All UI components have option to include or exclude from keyboard tab index. | Developers should make sure forms and webpages are keyboard accessible. A logical tab and focus order should be created. |

## 3 What Accessibility Guidelines Do Mendix Support?

Mendix supports the following guidelines:

* Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 levels A and AA (for more information, click [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/))
* Section 508 of the American Federal Communications Act as published in 2017 (for more information, click [here](http://www.Section508.gov))

## 4 What WCAG 2.1 Criteria Do Mendix Support?
